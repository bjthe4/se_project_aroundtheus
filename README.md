## 🔑 Key Features
  
* 📸  Dynamic Photo Sharing: Users can share photos and interact with them by liking or unliking.
* 📱 Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across devices.
* ✅  Input Validation: Ensures that all user inputs are accurate and meet the required criteria before submission.
* 💻  Advanced OOP Implementation: The project leverages advanced object-oriented programming techniques, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, to organize and manage the * application's codebase effectively.
  

## 🛠️ Technoloiges Used 
* JavaScript: Core programming language used to create interactive features.
* HTML & CSS: Structure and styling of the application.
* Advanced OOP: Implemented to enhance code reusability and maintainability.
* Webpack: Used as the module bundler to manage assets and dependencies.
* APIs: Integrated to handle data exchange between the front-end and back-end.

## 🚀 Advanced OOP Concepts
* 🔒 Encapsulation: Ensured that the internal representation of objects is hidden from the outside. Only the necessary functionalities are exposed through a public API.
* 🧬  Inheritance: Created a hierarchical structure where classes inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse.
* 🎭 Polymorphism: Allowed objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexible and dynamic code execution.

## Development Process
* 🛠️ Figma: Used for creating and sharing designs and prototypes.
